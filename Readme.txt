gkrellm-uguru for GKrellM2  

From  Tobias van Dyk.  
2005:
Because lm_sensors does not support the Winbond monitor chip (uGuru) used on some Abit motherboards here is a gkrellm plugin that provides some of the monitoring functions 

Note that Hans De Goede wrote an Uguru kernel module during 2006
